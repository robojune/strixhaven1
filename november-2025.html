      <h2>The Doctrine of Division</h2>
      <p class="meta-line">Unearthing the Dark Alchemy of N.K. Michaels — Part I</p>
      <p class="meta-line">By Albus Dumbledore</p>

      <p>
        The campus is buzzing with fear and speculation after an unmarked vial was discovered near the abandoned alchemy wing—an iridescent liquid that shifts hues under moonlight. At first glance, it appears harmless, but its unsettling aura has earned it a chilling nickname among students: <strong>Racism Liquid</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>The Discovery</h3>
      <p>
        A group of spellcraft apprentices found the vial during a late-night rune study. They reported a heaviness in the air, as if the walls themselves were holding their breath. The liquid glows faintly, pulsing like a heartbeat, and shifts from emerald green to deep violet under lunar rays. No label. No markings—only faint runes etched into the glass, barely visible under a scrying lens.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        “I divide without cutting, I poison without killing, I bind without rope, I whisper in silence. What am I?”
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Campus Security Warning</h3>
      <p>
        Students are urged not to touch, taste, or attempt to neutralize the substance. Security has cordoned off the area, but rumors persist that the vial was not alone. Some claim they saw footprints leading into the forest—footprints that vanished mid‑trail.
      </p>

      <h3>The Shadow of N.K. Michaels</h3>
      <p>
        Legends whisper of N.K. Michaels, a brilliant but dangerous alchemist expelled decades ago for experimenting with “social alchemy”—potions designed to manipulate trust and loyalty among magical beings. His obsession with purity and division led to catastrophic experiments, including the infamous Eastern Forest incident where entire sprite colonies disappeared overnight.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        “One drop could silence a species forever.”
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Michaels’ work was banned, his name erased from official archives. Yet the runes on the vial match those described in his final manuscript: <em>The Doctrine of Division</em>. Could this be his unfinished work resurfacing? Or is someone reviving his ideology in secret?
      </p>

      <h3>A Magical Creature Speaks</h3>
      <p>
        “I felt it before I saw it,” said Thyriel, a centaur elder from the northern woods. “The air thickened, and the ground whispered warnings. This is not a potion—it is a weapon. It seeks to divide, to poison trust. If Michaels’ shadow walks again, none of us are safe.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Pixies refuse to fly near the alchemy wing, and even the owls—keepers of campus secrets—have fallen eerily silent.
